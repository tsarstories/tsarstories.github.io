              Andrea watches herself in the mirror. She’s in a matching lemon two-piece suit, a gem found at the thrift
              store for $4.
              The shoulders are slightly too-big, and some would describe the colour as more of a soured buttery yellow,
              but she
              stands a bit taller in the suit. Her jaw sets confidently, her eyes alert.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Today’s breakfast lies in a bed of crumbs,
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              on a porcelain plate decorated with painted chilis.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              She pulls apart the apricot danish and shoves a piece into her mouth. The crumbs drift into the white
              sink, one sits on
              a smudge of fresh mint toothpaste. An old make up collection sits on the countertop; observe missing lids,
              smudges,
              empty canisters. A beat-up notepad covered in blue scrawl is propped against a bottle of mouthwash. She
              flips the page,
              wetting the paper. The moment holds gravity, Andrea watches her face closely. She prepares her speech.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              She pauses, watching herself mime an awkward laugh. No laughter comes out.
              He’ll say something cheesy, ask me if I’ve given up on my journalistic career.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “You’re always telling me that we should be writing things that are important. That we are the backbone of
              society
              because we can tell the people what they want to hear or what they should be hearing. And sometimes –
              actually, they
              never want to hear what we have to say. We are members of the human race – “

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Cheesy.

              “This isn’t a story about shitty half-baked politics, it’s about race politics!”

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Too controversial.

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “It’s about the roles and responsibilities of Asian-American women in – “

              Unconvincing.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Andrea pauses, catching her flustered expression staring back.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “It’s going to be funny. An opinion piece that pokes fun at Neo-Nazis who use right-wing politics as a
              front for their
              racist, xenophobic agendas,” </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              The words feel purposeful, right. She continues,
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “It’s about the Neo-Nazis who think that dating an Asian woman is ‘a white nationalist passage’. About the
              Asian women
              who don’t mind dating Neo-Nazis. About the Asian women who are Neo-Nazis. We’re going Freudian. We’re
              going into
              childhood trauma. But it’s a piece that will be light, a perfect accompaniment to Earl Grey and parfait on
              Sunday. I
              don’t even want to condemn them. I just want to put their own shit under their noses.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              And Pete will smile, nod his head and say, “And they can’t even sue us because it’s opinion.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              ~
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I am being pushed out of his office. Pete, in watery brown eyes, sunk shoulders glory, is preparing to
              usher me out.
              There is a voyeuristic quality to my truth-telling which scares him.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “Wouldn’t it be nice to read something that isn’t political gossip?”

            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I wave the idea under his nose, knowing the very thought smelt right, like fresh cinnamon doughnuts in a
              caking of
              powdery sugar. Pete hates hedonism.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “Please - let me write this piece.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I make myself small, defenceless. I know what draws men like “Slugline” Pete, Los Angeles Times Editor,
              from their
              burrows. It’s their misguided attempt at feeling like their egos can change the world. The male and
              literary ego are two
              sides of the same coin after all.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “You’re always telling me that we should be writing things that are important - ”

            </span></p>


          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              However, Pete is deep in his solitude, a borderline-retiree editor who has been miraculously blessed with
              a period of
              politics so densely fucked-up, in an industry so poorly funded, he’s one Adderall away from hitting the
              hay. He says no,
              with the strength of a packet daily affirmation.
            </span></p>


          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “On Plenty of Fish, there was a reported spike in searches for ‘Asian women’ in San Francisco after
              Richard Spencer’s
              conference on ‘Nationalism for the contemporary American’ earlier this month. The event didn’t have any
              media coverage.
              Take a stab at how much that increase was?”

            </span></p>


          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              He takes the bait, “30”.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “48. Visits to the Klan’s website had an increased traffic up to 25%. This isn’t a shot in the dark. This
              is numbers,
              statistics, Google we’re talking about. The Klan is remodelling because three K’s just don’t sound as good
              without a
              Southern drawl. Young white college-educated men are holding Nationalist conferences, banning us from
              attendance.
              Jonestown hicks aren’t running marketing anymore. These are smart men who make a claim to non-racism with
              the accessory
              of an Asian wife on their arm despite underlining their favourite passages in their dog-eared copies of
              Mein Kampf at
              night.”
            </span></p>
          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              He looks up at me, “So you want to condemn them and their, or these women?”. He puts his mug under the
              coffee machine,
              it ejects with a sad putty sound, “Or is it because I’m Jewish and you’re Asian so we should start
              rallying against the
              Neo-Nazis?”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I swear I saw almost the ghost of pride on his face. He tells me that the story will take years off my
              life, pin me as a
              wack-job conspiracist, or worse, paint me as the poster child for batshit, crazy, unreliable, Liberal
              politics. At that
              stage, he says, I am the wound and he will personally amputate my festering body from the direct line of
              the
              reputability of the paper. I try to look cool and composed.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “I don’t even want to condemn them. I just want to put their own shit under their noses.”
              He laughs. The air feels golden with Pete’s laugh. He cradles his mug with child-like observation, “Fuck
              Grand Wiz Joe,
              or John, or whatever the hell his name is.”
            </span></p>
          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “Exactly, I will give you something prophetic. Better than prophetic even.”
            </span></p>


          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Pete sits in the kitchen, drinking his coffee, savouring the feeling I’ve given him. Nothing needs to be
              said. I’ve been
              given the green. I smile fondly at him and hand over a packet of Splenda. I know he’s watching his diet. I
              have cotton
              on my tongue. No words come out. The crack of my leather boots on vinyl floorboards lightens the hallway.
              I step out, my
              keys jangle, and suddenly I’m in the desert again.
            </span></p>


          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              ~
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">

            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I hit a dirt mound,
              My tiny Volkswagen Beetle creaks with orthopaedic urgency.
            </span></p>


          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              The red dirt road continues, long and narrow covered in tiny lumps and burrows. It’s an uncomfortable
              drive but my mind
              distracts itself, lingering on the image of Pete’s smile in the kitchen. He hasn’t smiled privately in a
              while. The last
              public smile was over a quick morning tea, accompanied with the news that there would be no more
              administrative
              casualties, but even then, it was performative.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              In Pete’s heyday, he wrote a piece for the Times inquiring into the Bush administrations’ extraneous
              military activity
              in Iraq and the implications for the legacy trade war over weaponry which was ignited following the Soviet
              Union’s
              occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. It was an exemplar piece of investigative journalism and when he
              lectured at
              Berkeley in my final year, I felt a sense of awestruck. He was a celebrity in my eyes, shedding light into
              a brutish
              international policing and “probing deep into the psyche of American military involvement in the terrain
              of the Middle
              East”.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I knew deep-down, Pete felt like journalism was now an apeshit spectacle. Words were published before a
              proof and there
              was no longer a place for an editor who appreciated the old-world of print and ink. He would have been
              gladly let go, if
              not to mark the end of an era where writing was storytelling. “Let the kids eat the cake, we’ll all be
              dead soon
              anyway,” he would say.
            </span></p>
          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              ~
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Enroute is a small bar near the Canyons. From afar, it’s nested amongst the precarious rocks but drawing
              into the dusty
              parking lot, it’s just another bar. You would never guess that the bar was the go-to spot for The Doors
              and Hendrix in
              the 60s. It was now overrun with tourists making their way through America and the occasional writer in
              trail of the
              Kerouac’s and Ginsberg’s (the ones who had made American dirt romantic). The official Los Angeles tourism
              bus stopped
              there at 6pm on Wednesdays and Fridays too.
            </span></p>
          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I sit in the corner of the room drinking a seltzer, looking in. The crowd is smaller than usual, but they
              fill the
              space. My drink is nearly polished off. In one fell swoop, she’ll come and whisk the glass away, leaving a
              ring of water
              on the table. The kind of little detail which would drive my mother into a fit of rage. But she’s the cool
              girl, she’s
              young and hip, to her, wood is wood, not a relic of a fantasy, love or past. Maybe she’ll smile at me.
              She’ll ask,
              “Another?” and I’ll nod, yes. We might just understand each other. The final gulp of seltzer goes down
              smoothly. I make
              eyes out the window, muss my hair a little, pinch my cheeks. To look drunk is to look in love. To look in
              love is to go
              through the world unfeared.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I’ll feign a drunken look of contemplation.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “Are you Dasha?”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              She’ll be confused, perhaps she’ll wonder if she messed up my order. Her eyes will assess me, ponder if
              I’m a threat.
              But no, I’m just a slightly nervous, slightly drunk, harmless girl. Her voice will go saccharine with
              patronising
              sweetness.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I watch myself in the stained glass panes. My reflection looks back, positioned under a glassy angel
              catching Mary’s
              tears.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Eyebrows up, bambi eyes!

            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Dasha Yoon was in fact, a face which flitted onto Andrea’s screen one night. A photo of blonde-haired,
              blue-eyed
              Republican poster boy, Spencer Archibald, yelling upon his podium had become viral overnight. Clicking on
              user
              dashay07’s profile on a ‘Make America Great Again’ Instagram post of this image, opened up the rabbit
              hole. An hour
              later and Andrea was 4 years deep into Dasha’s life, invested. She devoured pictures upon pictures of her
              perfectly
              artisan lifestyle – interesting cocktails, secret leafy nooks, pretty post-hike bare-faced selfies. These
              images padded
              her forefront love-story with Spencer, or ‘Spence’ as she called him. They were high school sweethearts.
              Contrasting his
              larger than life self, he seemed sweet in her pictures, posing under maple coloured fall leaves and
              walking their
              year-old Labradoodle. They radiated a genuine warmth which was infuriatingly aspirational.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Andrea flips through her notebook. reading over the scraggly scrawl along the margins.
            </span></p>
          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              She had a shtick – she was beautiful. And with beauty came power.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              The line repeats itself as Andrea makes her way to the bar. The floor is syrupy from a menage of spilt
              cocktails. At the
              bar counter, Dasha wipes the maple countertops with a square of pink felt cloth. She has high carved
              cheekbones, and
              deliciously dark features. Her eyes are lined with dark kohl. The two girls make eye contact.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Andrea smiles,
              Dasha mirrors.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “Could I get another beer? From the tap’s fine.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Dasha nods, yes. The beer hits the glass frothy. She taps once, releasing some of the trapped bubbles. She
              fills the
              glass to the brim with minimal froth. It was somehow an unexpectedly kind gesture. She smiles, setting the
              drink in
              front of Andrea.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “That’ll be $6.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Andrea fumbles in her purse for a $10 note. Her fingers moved quickly around a lipstick, cards, keys.

            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “Are you Dasha?”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Her fingers graze a crumpled note.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “Yeah, have we met before?”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Inquisitive. Andrea smooths the paper between her palms.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “Probably not. My name’s … Candace. I follow your Instagram. I didn’t know if it was you, you look so
              different – with
              the eyeliner.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Dasha’s expression softens, girlish.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “Do you like it? I’m trying a new look.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Andrea places the crinkled bill on the counter. It sits defenceless.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “Definitely. It looks good. I’m actually here – I’m a journalist for a small paper. Um, we’re doing a
              review on this
              place for the Sunday section. Fun fact - did you know that The Doors and Jimi Hendrix used to party here?”
              The words tumble out articulately uncouth.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “I did, it’s the biggest selling point for working here in my opinion. I love The Doors. I can answer
              whatever questions
              you have. It’s dead now anyways.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              They turn in unison to observe the empty space. Only lone ranger types remained.
              Dasha pushes the bill back to Andrea.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “The drink’s on me.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              The conversation began with the beauty of the bar’s high arching windows. Dasha explained that she was
              upset the place
              wasn’t preserved as a church because she wanted to walk down the pews one day when she got married. I told
              her that
              sounded like a beautiful moment. Our conversation canvassed an assortment of topics. Dasha spoke with
              prosaic authority
              on the difference between farmer’s market produce and Wholefoods. We agreed cold cuts were only satisfying
              on a hot
              summer’s day straight from the fridge. Eventually, the question of our aspirations and goals came up, and
              I confessed
              brazenly, that I wished I was paid more and at a higher position at the paper. Dasha morosely looked
              around the bar, and
              exclaimed she wished she owned the place so she could transform it into something more boutique. “But he
              doesn’t want
              another thing to have to take care of – “
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              Her voice wavered.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              The conversation dies,
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I’m writing but I sense her studying me. She asks coyly, “You’ll scratch the last sentence, right? I
              didn’t mean
              anything by it. It just kind of slipped out.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I don’t answer. I think -
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              She clicks her tongue.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              The change is so sudden that only her eyes follow in the milliseconds after.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “I don’t want that last sentence published.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “Ok, you have my word it won’t appear in the Chronicles.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              My face is burning as I tell the lie, I look down at the quick notes I’ve scrawled over my notepad.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “What paper did you say you were with again?”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I look up. Her eyes have grown dark. I do not break eye contact.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “Los Angeles Chronicles – it’s a small print local publication.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              She nods, looking away.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “I would really appreciate it if you left your notes from today.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              She reaches for my notebook. I recoil, cramming it into my scrappy leather bag. Her hand hovers, stunned.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “It’s off the record. I promise.”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              She laughs. The sound is harsh. She pushes her body against the grain of the counter. Her face looms over,
              hostile.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “God, you’re a predictable bunch. Do you exploit your loved ones for the sake of a story too? You know
              what really stuck
              out to me when I saw you. God, this girl is really unhappy and unfulfilled, and she will never – “
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I grab my bag from the grubby stool, focusing on the neon exit sign. The only touch of Modernism in this
              shitty,
              claustrophobic -
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “Let me help you with your job as well, Candace. That’s probably not even your real name is it? Pathetic!”
              Faster. My boots lift of the sugary floorboards with a shlick. Her voice trails away -
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              “I’m assuming that you’re also a second-rate journalist so here we go - Enroute is a small bar located
              near the Canyons
              with a cosy and historic sentiment. The food and drinks are cheap. It’s a tourist favourite. But these
              people will
              eventually fall out of love with the idea of stale apple pie and brandy joints. This place will end up a
              pit in the
              Canyons. There’s your story. If you draw on your personal experiences of never quite being good enough at
              your job, or
              maybe in your relationships, you may be able to flesh it out. Hopefully, you can buy yourself a nice
              dinner on one of
              your lonely nights - ”
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              - to a silence. The doors swing shut with gusto.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I am outside and the lukewarm desert winds are choking me,
              Deep breaths,
              I try not to gag on the dust.
            </span></p>


          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              ~
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              There is a moment during the pits of night in the Californian desert when the dirt shimmers and is what
              could only be
              described as a ‘moonlight mirage’. The heat slowly dissipates from the seared dirt and in those scenes,
              people claim to
              see Mojave ghosts charging at them. Others, unrest spirits and souls wandering the empty land like omens
              announcing
              themselves. Tales of Marilyn Monroe dancing barefoot in the charred dirt to Sharon Tate making daisy
              chains with the
              devil himself, became the stuff of urban city legend.
            </span></p>


          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              The opal moon floats in the rear-view mirror and my body relaxes. Nocturnal chinchillas hop across the
              cool dunes, eyes
              bright and white. It’s dark now, ghost cacti and bumpy dirt roads.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              ~
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I open the doors, the lights are off.
              Sometimes I expect to see the small lamp by the window illuminated as if to say, I’m here, I care, you’re
              home. But to
              have those details there needs to be somebody else. I wonder how many texts, kisses, calls, dates it takes
              to make
              someone fall in love with a person only half-present. My keys tinkle, windchimes, as they hit the bottom
              of an Italian
              glass bowl my mother gifted me last Christmas. If that light was on, a small puff of dust would fly
              upward, snowy
              particles illuminated. Perhaps that would be a shimmering moment for me, something to journal down. To
              indulge in,
              before -
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I stare at myself in the mirror. Green light illuminates my face despite my non-ownership of green lights.
              The moth
              wings, bodies and souls have collected in the low-hanging light, scattering the warm glow cold. I dip my
              mouth under the
              faucet, taking a long drink. A plate of softened crumbs adorns the counter. Half a danish sits sullen on
              the bare
              porcelain. The sink continues to run, eventually brimming with water.
            </span></p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
              I take a deep breath.
              In my home I see moths in the night,
              I submerge my face under,
            </span></p>
