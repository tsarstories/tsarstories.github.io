                    I have a sour taste in my mouth as Aaron’s picture flits across my screen.
                    So, he really was becoming a musician. Well,
                    good for him. I change my tune, lofty. He finally got what he wanted and he’s
                    going forth with his new muse and her
                    crayon coloured hair, and they’ll gather ye round the campfire and make love
                    under the stars and mock Neo-Liberalism,
                    pledge sacrifice to Marx, Joyce, Plath and circle-jerk each other’s ego 
                    into tantric oblivion. Great!
                    </span></p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 2;" ><span style="color:#000000;">My new Alexander Wang 
                      sweatpants cling thoughtfully to my slim thighs as I run. Sunlight gazes over 
                      the neighbourhood,
                    hitting the trees just the way I like. I run purposefully. There is a certain 
                    charm about this street – high-arching
                    buildings and a huge foliage canopy coating the sky. It’s still city, despite 
                    the several townhouses with stucco
                    exteriors (who were they kidding?), but just enough suburbia exists to feel slow-paced.
                   </span></p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 2;" ><span style="color:#000000;"> Second shower of the day 
                      just to feel fresh. Put on heels. Pop a Ritalin. There’s a heavy-weight 
                      meeting today and I need to look alive. 
                    The Bohemian caravan nightmare still looms over me, but 
                    I repress that thought. I kiss T goodbye
                    as he’s on call with IT setting up his at-home-Apocalypse trading kit because 
                    <em>Money never sleeps</em>.
                    T is good looking. He works at Goldman Sachs. 
                    His father also worked at Goldman Sachs. His passions include the gym,
                    work and himself and he says he doesn’t take steroids. 
                    I touch his arm in an awkward show of affection and his muscles
                    flex under my fingers, jumpy, in a mind of their own.</span></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black"><span style="color:#000000;">
                    I must find someone palatable to date them. 
                    He has to be 6’2 because it is the golden ratio. 2 in 6 is 3 and that’s
                    God’s perfect number. 
                    Also, if I wear heels, we’re almost the exact same height just like Carolyn and John Jnr
                    and as a couple that’s insanely attractive.
                    </span></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;"><img src="img/rolodex/brett.jpg" alt="American Psycho art" class="center"></p>


                    <p style="line-height: 2;" ><span style="color:#000000;">I met 
                      Brian at a lame College party. The first thing he asked me 
                      was what I thought of Foucault’s essay <em>Discipline and
                    Punish</em>. I said it was agreeable, pretending I had read it and 
                    we continued our conversation from there. He offered to
                    get me a drink and I said, okay thanks. I pretended to sip on 
                    the beer. At the end of the night I was completely sober,
                    and Brian was drunk enough where his responses were brutally honest.</span></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black" ><span style="color:#000000;">
                      <em>Isn’t the concept of macroeconomics stupid because every 
                      20 minutes spent learning the damn thing the world’s already
                    taken new form. I’ve become redundant, some fucking computer’s taken my job.</em></span></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" ><span style="color:#000000;">His eyes bulge, frenetic energy pumping.
                     "Feel my arms," he mumbles. His
                      muscles strain so tightly I can almost trace the blue-green
                    veins with my index finger. I raise my eyebrow as if to ask, steroids? His arms confirm.
                    </span></p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 2;" ><span style="color:#000000;"><em>I don’t think a computer 
                      can wholly replace a trader.</em></span></p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 2;" ><span style="color:#000000;"><em>At a shitty mid-tier firm maybe, 
                      but not at Goldman.</em></span></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" ><span style="color:#000000;">He thumps his chest, points his hand to the sky as if to say, 
                      here I come baby. I roll my eyes. </span></p>
                      
                    <p style="line-height: 2;" ><span style="color:#000000;"><em>The work at Goldman is not 
                      simply through the opportunistic 
                      comings of nepotism if that helps you sleep better at night.</em></span></p>
                      
                     <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;"> He looks at me pointedly, as 
                      if to say, you wouldn’t 
                       understand that sort of world because you’re a left-wing 
                       Liberal Arts student with
                    a penchant for dreaming, too scared of the reality of your own skin even. 
                    We talk a little more until Brian passes out
                    on the foyer. Over the horizon the morning fog begins to condense. 
                    I’m still pumping with adrenaline from his look and I
                    think, this is flight or fight. Here is a man dismissing your 
                    character, your existence. Brian snores softly, then
                    loudly.</span></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" ><span style="color:#000000;">Brisk strides carry me to my office. 
                      I slot the brown paper bag under my arm as I walk past Monique, she’s inspecting
                    the new arrivals on her clothing rack, Starbucks in hand. I hear my name. I follow. 
                    She holds up a silky Anine Bing camisole.</span> </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2; ><span style="color:#000000;">My office is well-designed. It’s furbished in a 70’s deco 
                      Californian style with beachy woods and a careful collection
                    of German post-war Abstract art. Grim, but beautiful. A small 
                    record player is a fixture in the corner of my office. I
                    unbag the vinyl, tear off the thin coating of plastic and 
                    place it on the record player. </span></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black">
                    I want to criticize – just for 20 minutes as everyone is having their morning tea. 
                    I wish I broke his entire record
                    collection, 23 years of collecting down the drain in one moment with 
                    the help of a box-cutter. Ha! That would have given
                    him something to mull over. I’m not nice. But Aaron would have loved that
                     because men like Aaron love having things
                    happen to them.</p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black">The first chords of his band’s 
                      most popular song, <em>You</em>, begin to play through my office.
                    About 30 seconds in, I smile. I hate it. The non-descript lyrics are cryptic, 
                    the chords unoriginal, the cover art,
                    promotional pictures, uninspired. </p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black">I feel better, so what he gets to play music at
                     select venues and clubs? One day,
                    you’re no longer twenty-something and pretty, trampy girls aren’t throwing 
                    themselves at you. You realise your supposed
                    humble pursuit of musical art was really a thinly veiled attempt at 
                    <em>having</em> because when you were younger, you didn’t
                    have anything.</p>

                       I’m satisfied at the

                    her eyes fixated on the silvery fish flesh. You look beautiful today. 
                    She looks up and shoots one of her famously fake

                      other for about a year now, and we’ll continue to see each other because we’ve both
                    reached that stage in life where it was socially expected that we settle down and have
                     kids. We have a lot in common
                    too.</p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black">She’s just about to take a sip of wine and I’m almost excited about seeing her do her slight-nose-crinkle-cheek-redden

                    tight faced.</p>

                    He guffaws and slaps Julie’s shoulder in a playful way, as if two old friends reconnecting. I can sense she’s annoyed.
                    Her shoulders set. Suddenly she’s no longer so small. Her bones taught against skin. Face, grisly.
                    Anyways, what have you been up to? I barely seen you out nowadays. Todd told us about the fucking problem. He winks.
                    Of course, Todd told you. We should catch up sometime. Next week. Free seats at SOBU, Derrick’s paying for lunch.
                    We were both trying to go for the Meredith deal, is that a sore point?

                      Julie relaxes fractionally. She reaches for the wine.</span></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" ><span style="color:#000000;">
                    The city passes through the black-tinted lens of the Mercedes Classe A 
                    and I notice on a poster for the American Ballet,
                    angry red graffiti spelling out ‘Die Capitalist SCUM!!!!!!!’. 
                    All 7 exclamation points dribble down in a dusty muted
                    red.</span> </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black"><span style="color:#000000;">
                    Julie stares at her sparkling wedding ring – a 4.5 carat diamond set 
                    in a thick band fashioned with tastefully muted
                    gold. She glances at it every few minutes, as if inspecting if the diamond 
                    had dulled in colour.
                    </span></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black"><span style="color:#000000;">
                    Babe I think we should cut dairy from our diets. I read this article in the
                     Wall Street Journal that the industry is
                    getting fucking filthy with their production. Not even Dean & Deluca carry 
                    decent stuff anymore. I should tell Julietta
                    to throw away what’s in the fridge. You’ve been breaking out on your back which is alarming, especially for a 34 year
                    old man. I think I know why though. I know you’re lying to me.
                    </span></p>

                      I whip around.</span></p>

                      <em>What did you say?</em></span></p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black"><em>I know you’re trying for it.</em></p>

                      My tone is clipped, frank and I can sense Julie’s ego prickling. 
                    I am making her the nagging chastising wife, when she
                    pictured herself in this conversation as cool, sexy, understanding.
                    </span></p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;"><em>

                    Naturally the most inoffensive things are at the top. 
                    I watch her reach into the box and take out two clean syringes and
                    a small vial of Halotestin. Then opalescent glassy pills follow - 
                    they could be almost be mistaken for fish oils. Julie
                    grabs several bright yellow canisters. She opens them and pours 
                    the white pills onto the carpet, innocuous. Like
                    Skittles for her. Unfazed, onward her hunt.
                    </span></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black"><span style="color:#000000;">
                    Katie’s eyes widen at the steroids, she’s shocked. 
                    Her face becomes white, against her black bangs. </span></p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black"><span style="color:#000000;"><em>
                      Tim, are these yours?</em></span></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black"><span style="color:#000000;">
                      Julie continues to rummage through the box. 
                      She admires her new treasure - a collection of disks with cryptic dates
                    scrawled across them. 
                    She throws them across the room with a guttural scream. 
                    The wooden box reaches an end. There’s
                    nothing in it. She shakes it. There’s a slight thumping sound. 
                    Expertly, Julie tears open the secret compartment.</span></p>
                    
                   <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black"><span style="color:#000000;">
                    Katie’s crying.</span></p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black"><span style="color:#000000;"><em>
                      I can’t believe you’re doing this to me. I can’t believe everything about us was

                    <p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="color:#000000;">
                      She picks up her thick grey felt coat.
                    iPhone 6S. Unsuspecting, innocuous, old remnants of a past, she won’t care. 
                    Julie. Stop, there’s nothing there. But
                    she’s determined, she runs to the wall socket and plugs the phone in. 
                    The wait begins. I move towards her, I’m soft, I’m
                    forgiving. She can’t see what’s on the phone. No, don’t you fucking dare come any closer. 
                    She paces across the bedroom,
                    her diamond ring in palm. She’s rubbing her forehead, trying to numb her thoughts.
                    Something catches Katie’s eye on her way out. Black, shiny, hidden under my Armani shoebox. 
                    She picks up my rolodex and
                    begins to devour picture after picture. </span></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black"><span style="color:#000000;"><em>
                      Who are these girls?</em></span></p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 2;" style="color: black"><span style="color:#000000;">
                      She dissipates in on herself, quiet.</span></p>
