                  accents, hear their voices stretch out its syllables. I love the way my grandmother says ‘<em>Katharine’</em>. My
                  name does not mean hope or happiness, but I have filled it with good traits that belong to me. I think
                  ‘<em>Katharines’</em> have been given their name by pure luck. A mere trawling through the abyss of the English
                  language and finding something which seems familiar. Sundays are the sweetest day of the week. There is always soft
                  background music, the smell of fresh laundry. I always think of my name with the fondness I think of the weekend, of
                  Sundays.&nbsp;</span></p>

                  excellence in her body and mind. Her words became polished and beautiful. Her skin smoother, plumper. She became
                  youthful, her eyes wider, lashes slicker, hair healthier, nails stronger. The thought itself carried a weight over
                  her.</span></p>

                  Dark suburbia is scary. It's different from Hollywood films and pastel skies - more dangerous too. The glamorous
                  suburbs filled with stylish women who cry themselves to sleep at night -&nbsp;</span><i style="color:#000000;">that
                  is what we want</i><span style="color:#000000;">. We want Xanax and coke to ease the pain - it's scary to think that
                  the woman working three jobs can just end herself. The drugs and the lights dull almost compared to red lipstick of
                  the new wife. Oh, how should she pay for such a divorce, what glamour! What beauty - a tarnished nickel in the
                  water. A failed daughter’s cry-baby drug boy sicko killing his baby girl.</span></p>

                  An eye for an eye, I’m scared of consequences. So, I watch my shadow and step, avoid the pavement and keep an eye
                  down, my iris circling out. Crying through the veil of tears and watching for a bullet to come through my head. I
                  hear noises at night - a motorbike, howl hoot and bark from the animals - why should they yell at night? What is in
                  our suburbs that make us cry? Pageant queen smiles at me - why the placid look? I don't like her, she doesn’t like
                  me, what else is there to say with that look?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color:#000000;">I’ve recently become obsessed with drinking water. I drink close to 6-7 large cups of
                  water a day because it will make my skin perfect. This idea now defines my idea of beauty – <em>natural.
                  </em>Natural beauty is what will separate me from other girls. I use a thin layer of cream on my face every morning.
                  Recently, I have started getting larger bumps on my skin, my nose is dryer and slightly peeling and I’m not sure how
                  to stop this. I read an article that suggested that oils might moisturise as supposed to saturate your natural skin,
                  but oils feel greasy and summer is approaching. I firmly believe heels are essential in the beauty mantra.

              <p><span style="color:#000000;">M</span><span style="color:#000000;">y eyelids are so fat and heavy that my pupil is a
                  slit but I see her – all golden and taut and tan. <em>Holier than thou sort of girl</em>. She isn’t hardened like
                  the women I know – the Mishkas’ cold and silent in stony realisation, the women who endure hardship, labour and
                  brutality. She was a little girl, soft, buttery tissues tearing. Her laugh is wispy as I tell her that she is an
                  angel. So light it skims the fibers of my body, anchoring on heavy. She dances, disappears. Mishka and Getty sway me
                  away asking about the music, the drugs, the poetry but I can only answer with a “darn” or “yeah”, I run back. I am
                  absolutely besotted, flushed and I am in love again with an Angel with rosy lips and oily skin. This entire night
                  has been a blur, I am drunk on four-dollar scotches, crying in Mishka’s lap and I can only think of her.</span></p>

                <span style="color:#000000;">And men drink to smash glasses in ecstasy,</span><br>
                <span style="color:#000000;">Howl and whistle at beautiful women</span><br>
                <span style="color:#000000;">There sits a man lost in his world,</span><br>
                <span style="color:#000000;">he keeps drinking and drugging,</span><br>
                <span style="color:#000000;">slugging his body. </span></p>

                <span style="color:#000000;">And we can tell he is our poet extraordinaire,</span><br>
                <span style="color:#000000;">with his words and his coyness.</span><br>
                <span style="color:#000000;">All that boozing and smoking,</span><br>
                <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#000000;">with pipes,</span></span><br>
                <span style="color:#000000;">but he is still soft inside.</span></p>
