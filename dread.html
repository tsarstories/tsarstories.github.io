                Inherently a visual medium, the propensity for film to create meaning is dependent on the artistic manipulation of the
                frame, or alternatively “the shot”. It is precisely through the masterful compilation of painterly frames that Robert
                Weine creates a representation of the fragmented German psyche in his silent Expressionist film, The Cabinet of Dr
                Caligari (1920). The Cabinet of Dr Caligari serves as a highly political work and a prominent example of the German
                Expressionist movement, discarding the conventions of classical cinema and adopting counter-cultural and counter-cinema
                qualities as a means of expression and the artistic activism of a “movement of young people”. This ability to immerse an
                audience in story and engage them intellectually is highlighted in Weine’s film, which achieves a harmony between visual
                and sensory filmic form to effectively present a facet of the newfound German identity exiting the WWI. Intrinsically,
                this ability to represent and reconcile history through film reinforces the significance of filmic form in not only the
                reshaping of artistic traditions, but a device to create meaning for the audience.
                
                Historically, the emergence of German Expressionism in film came about in the last throes of wartime nationalism and
                exhibited a highly antagonistic and apprehensive behaviour to the traditional institutes which had governed her culture
                in the Weimar period. This drastic change in thinking, paralleling the upheaval in Germanic lifestyle, threw the nation
                into a period of rapid and unforgiving Industrialisation. In many ways, Weine translates these behaviours through the
                reinvention of traditional motif, adjusting meaning to be akin to these newfound values. This is most notable in the
                cyclical patterns of light and shadow which visually insinuate a meaning, oft-contradicted by the ‘realities’ of the
                narrative. Weine’s use of chiaroscuro lighting in the mid-shot of the desolate street, introduces us to the “scapegoat
                killer” in a subliminal fashion. The high tonal contrast between the killer’s white face and the plunging shadows
                surrounding him, evokes the sense of disruption and highlights his existence in the painterly set as an anomaly. Weine
                continues to follow the killer through this mid-frame shot, effectively building upon the anomaly of the frame as the
                audience concentrates on his exaggerated, expressionist movements. Similarly, Weine manipulates the frame in his
                circling onto the anguished woman’s face creating a circular halo lens around her. Traditionally, our understanding of
                light encompasses the heavenly, however the heavy costuming and makeup on the woman allows her appearance to be
                interpreted as spectral and lifeless.
                
                Intrinsically, Weine’s fascination with the psyche is translated into his reproach to classical cinema. Building upon
                the reinterpreted use of lighting as detached from trope meanings, Weine presents his narrative through the lens of
                simultaneously stillness and exaggerated movement, creating a cerebral experience for the audience to be immersed in.
                The highly cerebral quality of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari is one of most jarring aspects upon viewing, whereby our
                traditional understanding of narrative is challenged with the insertion of unreality . Weine’s heavily cubist and
                abstract set design, when immersed under chiaroscuro lighting, creates a visceral animated effect, akin to the nausea of
                the Dutch tilt angle. In many ways, this visual representation of their relationship highlights one of the central
                concerns of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, being an acute fear of dictatorship and mind-control. The lifeless, corpse-like
                Cesare confined in his small coffin is directly contrasted against Caligari who is larger and commandeering through his
                highly expressionist movements. The complete powerlessness which Cesare exhibits, parallels those who were essentially
                “nationalist fodder” in the Great War. Weine’s skeptical reflection upon wartime atrocities and the general discontent
                with the actions of those in power is prevalent in his attempt to bring to the forefront the importance of
                accountability. In many ways, the contrast between the ordinary scapegoat man’s fate and Cesare’s lies in the ambiguity
                of actions and intent which were central concerns following the WWI.
                
                The irresolution which typifies the ending of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari is crafted through Weine’s careful selection of
                frames which propose an alternate truth, alluding to Francis’ dreamscape and untruthful authorship. A key moment which
                this is evidenced is through Weine’s close-up on Caligari’s face through a circular zooming frame which allows
                Caligari’s gaze to puncture the audience. Weine directs Caligari to project a purposefully blank yet colluding
                expression to the audience, which is left to interpretation. This subliminal breaking of the fourth wall grasps for the
                audience’s interpretation and fuels Weine’s fascination with the unreliability of perspective and the inherent bias and
                subjectivity associated with narrative. The pattern of Weine’s circular framing of the face expresses a greater interest
                in the psychology of film-making and reflects the extent to which the attempt to access the Freudian aspects of the mind
                permeated the conceptual underpinnings of German Expressionism. The mirroring of the audience’s anxieties onto the
                preformed narrative basis of Weine’s characters reflects the remarkable quality of the counter-cinema movement. By
                creating a bilateral relationship between the audience and the film, the uncertainty of our own reality and truth is
                brought to the forefront. Furthermore, Weine incorporates surrealist elements into his set construction, which can be
                seen in the consecutive shots of the extern of Caligari’s small rickety shed, and the elaborate staircase which it
                houses. This creation of sensory illusion and the slow pacing of this mid-frame shot tracking the three men entering
                darkness, establishes a sense of dread and foreboding. Our private anxieties and fears are one and truly with the
                narrative.
                
                Thus, in many ways the integration of the audience’s experiences into the narrative of the characters is the hallmark of
                a powerful film. This is precisely what Weine achieves in The Cabinet of Dr Caligari whereby the melding of fiction and
                reality is created through the filmic harmony of set construction, lighting and narrative which come together in the
                frame. Weine creates a unique filmic dialogue challenging the traditional tropes and visual cues of cinema, to create a
                stimulating work which acts as conduit of the anxieties of the individual and nation.</p>
