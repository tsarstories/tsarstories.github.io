                            <p class="synopsis">
                            Crowd surf with your eyes. It’s an exhilarating Californian party which means beautiful girls surrounded by much older
                            men. I watch them while I’m sitting pretty at the bar.</p>

                            <p class="synopsis">Their faces begin to swim together and it’s difficult to differentiate the eyes and lips and the hair because it all
                            becomes the same girl on the magazines, TVs and billboards. But I spot Jemima immediately because she stands out -
                            slightly more sparkly than the rest. She’s in a thin canary yellow dress, her form a stark outline against the Mondrian
                            adorning Hugo’s living room. Sing-song-y around the right people. She’s all soft, cute – no to the freefalling liquor.
                            Everything’s soft dusty browns, liquid caramels and nude leathers. Gin sloshes on my bare skin.</p>

                            <p class="synopsis">Headrush. Blood pumping but somehow, the world turns slower. I absorb the finer details. The similarities between us. I
                            could feel that we had the same mind. We were snow sisters. We had the same glassy-eyed dismal reality where finding
                            anything worth feeling jittery over was hard. Were we the small-town girl walking into Hollywood cliché? No. We weren’t
                            a dime a dozen. We both hid that history and cleaned our closets of any skeletons, any dusty remains. The dust glittered
                            only over our shoulders at Christmases and Birthdays when we became real actresses mustering up a lie about how hard it
                            was to make rent in LA and how waitressing was rough, our tails tucked between our legs as we guiltily accepted the
                            accompanying cheque in the mail for a hundred dollars to help the month go by a little quicker. We became the girl we
                            never wanted to be for those minute phone calls and then continued living in our fragile realities.
                            </p>

                            <p class="synopsis">All the secrets hidden in the cocaine, Pablo Neruda and shitty philosophy from guys with thin moustaches and greasy
                            roots. This very type of guy buys me a drink right now attracted to me like a vulture to his drunk bunny prey. I
                            greedily gulp down the glass of Prosecco ignoring his advances. Too late, his hand plays with my skirt. Jemima and I
                            knew the world in a way which was too familiar and as I watch Hugo’s fingers dance on her dress like the dead-eyed
                            Playboy bunny by the pool – I know that we will have the same ending too.</p>

                            <p class="synopsis">I hurl into the bushes. Watery. Double vision for a quick second until I no longer feel my lashes. Hiccup crazily.
                            Forgetful fumbling for my phone. And I see neon red eyes leeching onto my skin. I hurl some more forgetting I had just
                            puked, an oblivion drunk. Slowly falling into the scratchy bushes, a second coating of wooliness. A hand collects my
                            messy hair into a ponytail. Momentarily, I am stunned. But her voice whispers into the back of my throbbing head. I
                            watch her bounce away golden daisy bobbing into the Hollywood Hills dancing for the wolves to never surface again. I’m
                            haunted by her words. Where there is money, there is always blood. The vampires circle in. I don’t touch another drink.</p>
